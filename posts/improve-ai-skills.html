            <h1>Improve Your AI Skill Now: Adapting to the Earth-Shaking Shift</h1>
            
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>We are living in one of the scariest and most exciting times in history, and most people don't even realize it's happening right now. By the end of next year at the latest, AI will decimate the majority of coding jobs. If you haven't noticed, AI is getting incredibly good at writing code. Humans will still have to babysit these systems for a while—but for how long?</p>

                <p>You might say, "Thank god I am not in the tech industry." Sorry to break it to you, but it’s coming for your job soon enough. And let’s be frank: what many people do in their daily professional lives is actually a lot easier than writing code. If your entire day is filled with emailing, writing Word documents, and filling in cells in Microsoft Excel, you are in the crosshairs.</p>

                <p>It’s almost poetic that AI will disrupt white-collar jobs first. And let’s not kid ourselves: many of these roles were arguably redundant to begin with. The realization that will hit people hardest is the truth that "1s and 0s" can do their job better than they can. If an algorithm can outperform you, what were you doing for eight hours a day, every waking moment, for the last twenty years? Did your job matter? Did your life matter at all? These are heavy questions, but they are becoming unavoidable.</p>

                <h2>Where Do We Go From Here?</h2>
                <p>The short answer is: I don't know yet. I feel like Dr. Strange in the Marvel movies, peering through millions of possible futures. Hopefully, I’ll find the few where humans come out on top.</p>

                <p>In the meantime, here is what I’ve been doing. I am trying to educate myself as much as possible on how to work <em>with</em> AI better than anyone else. While most people are sleepwalking through this earth-shaking event, I am actively recalibrating the way I think.</p>

                <p>The more I learn about AI and watch it evolve, the more I realize that my old way of working and thinking wasn't aligned with how AI "wants" to operate. We can never compete with AI on raw knowledge—it has scrapped the entire internet. However, we can still be more creative than AI. That is our strength.</p>

                <p>I feel like I need to be <strong>quick and slow simultaneously</strong>. I honestly don’t even know exactly what that means yet, but I will write another blog post once I believe I’ve figured it out.</p>

                <p>The great news is that everyone—including the people I consider extremely smart—is still figuring this thing out. It is the Wild West. But make no mistake: this window of opportunity won't stay open forever. Now is the time to start learning.</p>
